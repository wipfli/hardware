# Box

This folder contains the Autodesk Inventor files used to make the 3d printed enclosure of the ballometer. Since these files are not text-based, they are not part of the git repo. You can still download the files in the [releases section](https://github.com/wipfli/hardware/releases).

## Changelog

* ```box-rev-1``` First 3d printed box for the ballometer.
* ```box-rev-2``` Increase height of power bank holder. Add slit for USB power cable. Increase access to SD card. Add honeycomb venting holes. Add missing chamfer. Add logo.
